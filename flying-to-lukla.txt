While we wait to be checked in, I watch a stout Nepalese woman collect her cargo as it goes through the security x-ray machine. She grabs at huge mesh bags of potatoes and garlic, while unmarked brown boxes, bursting-full white burlap sacks and strangely shaped objects wrapped in newspaper topple all around her, exiting the x-ray machine with no obvious owners. Nobody is terribly concerned. Cargo far outstrips people in this room which hosts a dozen check-in counters lining the walls, many unmanned, all single-serving size and more like booths at a carnival than any kind of official enterprise. Despite the growing number of inanimate objects being shoveled in, the room bustles with activity. Trekkers are checked in or, like us, waiting for a chance or sometimes just sitting patiently as if they had nowhere to go. Sherpas carry their unwieldy burlaps sacks or unmarked boxes or giant containers of cooking oil here and there while people in various forms of uniform—suits, reflector vests, pilot jackets—walk around with no obvious concern for checking us in.

Eventually a woman takes pity on us, exchanges our proof of purchase for a large blue bookmark stamped with our flight number, 22, and writes down our names and passport numbers on a piece of paper titled ‘Passenger List.’ She weighs each of our packs before whisking them away and returning to weigh us. I am delighted that they are weighing things, though mildly concerned that nothing is recorded. 

From here we enter the departure terminal, which involves walking through another metal detector which always beeps when I go through it and always results in a perfunctory but intimate pat down. The departure terminal is merely another large room, in which a variety of broken lights hang from the ceiling and a pleasant family of pigeons enjoy the rafters. We spend our time eyeing the other trekkers, questioning their and our choices of shoes, wondering if they are trekking independently like us, and staring in awe at the genius of an older woman who brightly opens a large tupperware container of homemade cookies. 

Mostly we wait. My mind is numbed by the cold. I have stupidly left my jacket in my pack and overheard a woman explaining that the cabin will not be pressurized and, I infer, not heated. I warm up by envisioning our plane crashing, bracing myself for the impact and predicting my chances of survival, both from the crash and then, making it through that, from escaping the plane before it blows up in smithereens. The fantasy is vague. I haven’t yet seen the plane.

Flight 22 is called. Ten of us exit the building and pile onto a bus, which is driven in a large arc around a number of planes on the tarmac. We pull up to a small, boxy plane with landing wheels jutting out from the main body and a tail spur tied down to the plane with loose wires. A tank parks itself near the left wing. A man walks up a small metal step-stool with a large hose from the tank in hand and threads it into a connector on a wing. Simultaneously a generator parks itself next to the cockpit and another man plugs in its three-phase connector to a socket just north of the cockpit door. Our bus pulls away, we circle a slightly bigger plane, shinier and cleaner, and return our dumpy one. Now cargo is being chucked into a luggage compartment just behind the passenger segment, the burlap sacks thrown in with the hiking packs and and duffel bags and there is no way it will all fit back there, we think, especially given the way the men throw it in haphazardly.

I can’t decide if I want the bigger or smaller plane. The bigger plane is sturdier, has more inertia, is more likely to make it through a storm or weather an emergency landing. The smaller plane is more nimble, can take off and land with a smaller footprint. 

Soon we discover where the extra luggage goes. We file out of the bus and one by one step up in the plane, all hunched over to take one of the eleven seats. Four seats line each side, then a set of three on a bench in the back. Extra luggage is tied down wherever it fits, mostly ahead of the two rows and behind. I get the last seat on the left and buckle in with the standard airplane seat belt. A single red-lipped hostess walks down the single aisle with a straw basket of cotton balls and milk toffees. I follow suit of the others, grabbing cotton balls for my ears and a milk toffee for my nerves. She barely makes it to the back of the plane before the propellors start thundering, an utter roar that sends us speeding down the unmarked tarmac and taking to the air smoothly.

We soar over Kathmandu, its rectangular buildings sporting out-jutting windows and a variety of pastel colors, creams and browns and pinks and yellows and blue, all multi-story and slightly off kilter with each other. They fan out in all directions, then thin, then disappear as the land becomes green and brown and mountainous. For a while there is nothing but hills and the speckled pattern of green trees far below, then we start to see the tan single-track roads zigzagging up and down between clusters of tin-roofed houses or something between nothing at all. Now the hills start to rise, they get vigorous and serious and we get closer to them, our shadow a faint spot that crystallizes into the tiny, dark mimicry of our plane flying over the entrance to the Himalayas.

Finally I spot the snow-capped mountains in the distance, which melt first into a cascade of brown before finding their connection with the greenery below and disappearing into a blue haze, utterly disconnected from the hillside below. I don’t see Lukla as we approach but suddenly the tarmac is below us and we rumble onto it, our thundering growing as we desperately brake up the slope and sharply turn to the right onto a small section of tarmac, big enough for four tiny planes. Immediately a waiting plane takes to the landing strip and from my window I see it shoot down the black road, lifting into the air mere meters before the tarmac itself disappears with the mountain leaving nothing but a straight drop down the cliff.

We do not bother with the arrival terminal; perhaps there is none. We walk off the plane into another collection of cargo, stacks and stacks of soft drinks and cans and beer wrapped in grubby plastic. We grab our packs from the mess. There is mild concern that people take their own bags. We are first asked to produce a baggage receipt by a man with a badge and then left to our own devices, no receipt collected. On the top of my pack, spilling on the the right shoulder strap and down the side onto my sandals is a yellow goo, remnants of a cracked egg. Later I see the huge stacks of eggs in kitchens, twelve by twelve cardboard trays stacked twelve high. We grab our packs and go.

To where, exactly? The tarmac is surrounded by a high barbed wire fence and then a dusty stone path with which we will become intimately familiar. Around the path are buildings, one deep, sporting names which will also merge into each other the longer we are here, Buddha Lodge, Everest Summit Lodge, Yeti Mountain Home Lodge. They curve up and around the airport, which despite its 12% incline is the flattest thing around. 

As we walk almost the full 180 degrees around the tarmac we notice the people carrying cargo everywhere. Some hold their loads on the shoulders but most use a thick strap over their forehead, leaning precipitously forward, a hand to the load on their back. They wear jeans or slacks or knock-off hiking pants, sweaters or fleece jackets, sneakers or cheap rubber sandals with socks or not. The path is rocky, dirty, mostly long shallow steps, and there is shit everywhere, though we don’t yet see any donkeys or yaks.

We get a room at The Nest Lodge and drop our packs, head out for breakfast at the Buddha Lodge where we can watch the planes taking off. The planes take off immediately after another has arrived. They drive out to the top of the tarmac strip, first facing the mountain and then making a sharp turn to face their path. They rev their engines, the sound of the props filling the whole town, and then they rumble down the strip gaining speed. Each plane takes off with it’s own distance from the end of the runway, but they all take off before the end, lifting up into the thin mountain air to fly trekkers and porters home. 

My heart is pounding. I feel nervous and can’t relax, but I suspect it’s also the altitude: at 2800m we’re getting 70% of the normal amount of oxygen. After breakfast we explore Lukla, which apart from it’s ring of lodges is a single road which we could follow all the way to Namche Bazar, the next town we head for. Instead we stop where the buildings end, at a large white gateway adorned with the bust of a smiling woman and paintings of prayer-pressed hands and flowers. We are eager to keep going, to get out, to walk, but we spend a day in Lukla to acclimatize, letting our hearts catch up to us. 

The single road is chocked full of shops which sell everything we might need and much we do not: sleeping mats, knock-off outdoor wear, ornate knives, duffel bags, various shampoos and lotions and sunblock, knit booties and gloves, running shoes, incense, yak soap, tea, one liter sealed bottles of water, canned fruit juice, soy sauce, corn grits, pasta, dry meat, corn flower, bouillon, almonds, porridge, crushed rice, ladles, plastic traps, candy bars, chapstick, hats of all kinds. We buy some muesli and trail mix and berries, along with a package of oreos which become increasingly stale with depth and we eat in the early afternoon, mostly out of boredom. 

Of course, we are here for the mountains and we are in them. Across the valley they are close and vivid things, dark brown and jagged with depth from the snow that peppers to the top of them. We look at the peaks we can see from Lukla and understand that we will be trekking high above them. We walk up to a view point. Past the buildings we find steep and rocky trails, scraggly vegetation that holds on for dear life to the side of the mountain, gnarled trees staking their claim in this dangerous region. In the sun the heat bears down on us but in the shade or inside we chill easily. In the afternoon the clouds roll in, eye level and close but not touching us. Their hide our view of the mountains, turning everything past the runway into a grey empty void which at once feels right in front of my eyes and very distant. 

We see almost no one. Often we walk into a restaurant or shop and no one greets us. Occasionally a local comes out of the shadows or from next door, but mostly no one comes at all. We see no other trekkers until the afternoon, when we meet a pair of Japanese men who had walked from Jiri, the five-day alternative to flying to Lukla. They are tired, but smiling at their big burgers and their big map. Towards the evening the kids come out, toddlers who play roughly with stray puppies, eight year old girls in uniforms of red sweater, dark pleat skirt, and white pants, older boys in uniforms of slacks and dark blue sweaters, and older girls in matching uniforms to their younger counterparts, blowing bubbles with their gum and telling jokes in Nepalese which we understand to be dirty. We notice snooker tables under tarps around which men congregate, and a ping-pong table in the open which becomes popular around 5pm. Still, we don’t see many other hikers.

We eat dinner in what appears to be a woman’s home. Out front is a sign advertising ‘Sherpa Restaurant’ and listening a number of meal options with pictures: Dal Bhaat, Buff Momos, Veg Fried Noodles, (more!)  As we enter the doorway, hung with fabric tied in a knot at chest level, we immediately hit a table pulled up against a bench on the right. Past that is a small counter, behind is her kitchen of clay stoves and huge pots. Across from the bench and table we sit at is another mirrored, and there sit two Nepalese men who talk to the woman non-stop and occasionally help translate what we say. Along with the woman, clearly in charge as she takes our orders, cooks, and chats with the men, are two other woman who talk with her while she prepares our food. 

She prepares dal bhat for us, with which we become intimately familiar on our trip. It is a huge plate of white rice, sided with stir fried potatoes and bok choy and carrots and a bowl of lentil soup. She also grabs a handful of prepared moms, large dumplings stacked high in a mixing bowl covered in a towel, and reheats them in a bowl with a spicy soup. In addition she offers us hot milk tea out of an enormous thermos in glass mugs, which is sweet and dark. She speaks hardly a lick more English than the names of the dishes. The food is delicious and very salty. She offers us more stir fried veggies and rice for our dal bhat, more tea, and we eat until we are stuffed and then drink some more tea. 

Eventually the men leave and then so do the women. We are left finishing our scraps while the woman drinks her own concoction from a mug and stares calmly out the door into the street, or sometimes at us. Eventually we feel we should leave and she punches the cost of the meal into a calculator, the ubiquitous solution to transactions here. It is absurdly cheap. We want to pay her more but fear it would appear rude. We pay her and take our leave.

We return to our lodge, which is toasted by a large metal stove in the middle. We sit for a while, reading and writing, listening to the group of Australians to our right get to know each other, asking the group of Americans to our left, who had just returned from Everest Base Camp, what the conditions were like. We planned to the the Three High Passes trek, over Kong Ma La, Cho La, and Renjo Pass. We had read that it was the best trek in the Himalayas and one of the best treks in the world. The passes were all over 5000m and stunning. We could hike it without a guide because the trail is well traveled. We could easily hop up to Everest Base Camp if we wanted. Each pass is accessible independently so we could skip one or two if conditions or our bodies required. In addition, there was decent information about it online, unlike other recommended treks for which we could not even find maps.

But we had heard that maybe some of the passes would be closed. We started to ask everyone we conversed with, especially people on their way down, about the conditions. At breakfast a guide told us the 1st pass might be open, the 2nd probably not. He said we would definitely need crampons, big metal spikes attached to the bottom of your boots which we did not bring. At dinner a guide told us just Cho La Pass is still closed, but it might be open in a week. He implied the others were open. He clarified that ‘open’ meant guides had taken trekkers across it. The trail was laid in the snow. ‘Sometimes it takes a single crazy group to cross the pass, then everyone else can follow their steps safely.’ We would not be the crazy group — nor would we be the first followers. We wanted it to be open for several days, such that many groups had successfully passed. 

Our map gave us more reasons to have trepidation. It advised crampons along parts of the trail and sometimes ropes, warned of crevasses (stay left!) and slippery descents. Oscar began suggesting we don’t do them even if they are open, with good reasons: he knows next to nothing about glacier travel or crevasse rescue, and I know even less. We don’t have crampons or ropes or ice axes. The map confuses me. I read about the trek online, so did Oscar. No one ever mentioned needing crampons or knowing about crevasse rescue. There were warnings that the passes were dangerous, but merely to ‘seek local advice’. No one said ‘You don’t look like you should do the passes’ or ‘Do you know about crevasses rescue?’ Instead that stated which were open and which were not, and how they might open soon.
