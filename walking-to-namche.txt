We wake to the sounds of planes arriving and leaving, their thundering as loud in this plywood-walled room as outside. I did not sleep well. I woke to my own coughing or the sounds of scurrying in the walls. Could rats survive up here? I dreamt of missing a flight in Japan, from which we had just arrived a couple days ago, the receptionist at the check-in counter admonishing me for not being Japanese. My response to her, a similar accusation that she wasn’t very Western, came out of my mouth in the real world too, waking Oscar in the middle of the night who woke me, telling me I was having a nightmare, though I didn’t admit to him its mild nature.
