We wake to the sounds of planes arriving and leaving, their thundering as loud in this plywood-walled room as outside. I did not sleep well. I woke to my own coughing or the sounds of scurrying in the walls. Could rats survive up here? I dreamt of missing a flight in Japan, from which we had just arrived a couple days ago, the receptionist at the check-in counter admonishing me for not being Japanese. My response to her, a similar accusation that she wasn’t very Western, came out of my mouth in the real world too, waking Oscar in the middle of the night who woke me, telling me I was having a nightmare, though I didn’t admit to him its mild nature.

We start hiking around 9am and as soon as we cross the gate the mountains shoot up around us, becoming huge and ever present. They are great beasts that we skirt around, climb up the edge of and then drop down, criss-crossing a roaring turquoise river on large suspension bridges dangling between the mountainsides, watching the thick steel cables sway back and forth precariously with the rhythm of our steps. When we stop I shoot looks back where we came, a great, hazy gap in the mountains that stretches out to the horizon. Forward is not nearly so clear: it is all dirt path into a closed panorama of mountains which shoot high into the sky to collect clouds fanning off their top.

We pass through village after village. We pass trains of yaks and donkeys. We pass and are passed by the porters, carrying their impossible loads, and by other groups of hikers. The other hikers are all shapes and sizes. We are certainly the youngest out there, most looking like fit thirty-year-olds, with the occasional group of old men and women who I am amazed can make the trek, because the hiking is hard.

And oh, is it hard. It is wonderful. Our path is all up the mountainside and down to the bridge, up over a mole hill and back down to a village. Every step feels like the last piece of myself that I can give to this place. Then, and it is the most magical thing in the world, I take another step, and another. I continually walk, all day, the exhaustion heaving at me like a hot breath down my back. This is why I love to hike. I love to feel empty and know I can go on. To think of nothing but the strange way my feet keep pushing me further.

We arrive in Monjo for lunch. It is the same elevation as Lukla. The entire morning we just dipped down into the valley and back up again, a great big exercise in foolishness, just to take us back where we started. We are close to Namche but decide to spend the night in Monjo. We both have mild headaches and it makes sense to climb slowly since we have plenty of time in our schedule. At the random lodge we pick we wash our clothes under a freezing cold tap. I wet my hair, massaging yak milk soak into it luxuriously and then washing it out while stamping my feet to distract myself from the chill. The clouds have settled in, starting to grey in the distance we could so easily pierce through in the morning. We hang our clothes on the fence but it is clear they won’t dry. I start to think we might be in the clouds. I can hardly see to the edge of the town.

We are the only ones staying in our lodge that night. Again, all the walls are paper thin. Being inside counts for nothing, the temperature drops quickly and we shuffle around in our down jackets, bumbling away the time until dinner by walking around the town. This means walking up and down the path to Namche, stopping where the buildings stop, passing the other lodges and admiring the fields of bok choy and potatoes, the only things I can see growing in the fields that pepper all the cities like large animal pens. All around is construction. Huge stone lodges are being built. Men are digging in the dirt to dredge up the stones, hitting them with huge hammers to send spindling cracks down their center and eventually leaving them in smaller pieces. 

As the light fades out behind the mountains we retire to our lodge, eating an hours long dinner, starting with a huge pot of sweet milk tea that we nurse as our food is cooked. We bring in our wet clothes. We discuss the hike, our plan for the next day, the food and the weather and our lives, we talk about building a house and returning to our jobs, we talk about the owners of the lodge. I talk about how I’m not tired, how I wished we could have hiked further. Then we slip into our sleep bags. I nurse my head ache and my nerves, which jitter like a live wire inside of me. But I sleep.

The next day the hike becomes more beautiful. We still cross the river, the bridges growing colorful with prayer flags tied along their railings which blow achingly in the wind like a tribute to color amidst this harshly tonal place which is all brown and green and now, as the climb begins, white. Ah yes, white mountains, snow capped and distant, form at the horizon when we can glance at it though our own beasts. Up the climb to Namche we overhear a guide point out Mt Everest, a little protrusion behind a range of white mountains blowing clouds off their peaks in the distance. We stare at the sucker, who looks meager compared to his closer compatriots and even to the rocky green-coated hills we ascend that day.

The final climb is brutal and I become all huffs and puffs, focusing on my feet which continually take me up. Finally we enter Namche, which materializes around the side of the mountain suddenly, and because it is Saturday we pass first through the market, a small landing on which Sherpas through out their wears in bulk. Giant burlap sacks of lentils and peas and rice and sugar, along with cartons of candy bars and ledgers and pens and sneakers. Just past the market an Asian guy pokes his head of the the window and shouts down to us, recommending the lodge he’s sitting in. We are struck by the offer and go.
